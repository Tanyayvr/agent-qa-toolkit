Agent QA Toolkit
Portable Evidence Packs for tool-using AI agents
- Offline, self-hosted, no data egress
- CI gate decisions + security signals
- Target: platform/QA engineers shipping agents in production

Problem
- Incident handoff is still screenshots + partial logs
- Sharing runs outside your tracing UI is slow or impossible
- Tool I/O and retrieval context are scattered
- Secrets/PII make sharing risky

Solution
- One run → one portable Evidence Pack
- report.html (human) + compare-report.json (CI contract)
- assets/ + manifest.json with sha256 integrity
- Strict verify: portability + integrity checks

How It Works
- Runner executes cases against the agent
- Evaluator diffs baseline vs new
- Outputs Evidence Pack (offline, shareable)
- CI consumes per-case gate decisions

What You Get
- Regression diffs per case
- Root cause attribution (RCA)
- Security scanners (PII, injection, exfiltration, risk)
- Self-contained, portable report directory
