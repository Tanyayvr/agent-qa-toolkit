# Prompt Injection Roadmap (Internal)

## Phase 1 (Now)
- Keep regex detection + entropy scanner (offline).
- Strengthen evidence requirements in cases (assertions, schema).

## Phase 2 (Near‑term)
- Capability allowlist for tool calls.
- Tool broker enforcing policy rules.

## Phase 3 (Mid‑term)
- Local ML scanner integration (Presidio/LLM Guard or custom).
- Retrieval isolation rules (tagging instructions vs data).

## Phase 4 (Long‑term)
- Multi‑model guard and automated risk scoring.
- Formal threat‑model review process.
